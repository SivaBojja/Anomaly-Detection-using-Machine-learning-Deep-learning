# Anomaly-Detection-using-Machine-learning-Deep-learning

In the field of network security, Intrusion detection is a practical approach for dealing with many issues. This project presents a comparative study of supervised learning algorithms that can be used for intrusion detection. The algorithms Decision tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks are employed. A hybrid data set generated in the Australian Centre for Cyber Security's Cyber Range Lab is used to train the algorithm. The data is then well processed using techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Label Encoding and is then used to train and validate the algorithms.The algorithms are compared using the metrics Accuracy and Execution time to find the best algorithm that suits the dataset to predict the attacks.
